/***
 * \constraints
 * ${1:the conditions for the function's participation in overload resolution.}
 *
 * \mandates
 * ${2:the conditions that, if not met, render the program ill-formed.}
 *
 * \expects
 * ${3:the conditions that the function assumes to hold whenever it is called; violation of any preconditions results in undefined behavior.}
 *
 * \effects
 * ${4:the actions performed by the function.}
 *
 * \sync
 * ${5:the synchronization operations applicable to the function.}
 *
 * \ensures
 * ${6:the conditions (sometimes termed observable results) established by the function.}
 *
 * \result
 * ${7:for a \grammarterm{typename-specifier}, a description of the named type; for an \grammarterm{expression}, a description of the type and value category of the expression; the expression is an lvalue if the type is an lvalue reference type, an xvalue if the type is an rvalue reference type, and a prvalue otherwise.}
 *
 * \returns
 * ${8:a description of the value(s) returned by the function.}
 *
 * \throws
 * ${9:any exceptions thrown by the function, and the conditions that would cause the exception.}
 *
 * \complexity
 * ${10:the time and/or space complexity of the function.}
 *
 * \remarks
 * ${11:additional semantic constraints on the function.}
 *
 * \errors
 * ${12:the error conditions for error codes reported by the function.}
